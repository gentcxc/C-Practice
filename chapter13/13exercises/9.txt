You stare at this problem and may wonder the way that it acts.
s1="computer
s2="science"
if (strcmp(s1,s2) < 0)  <----This is true, And I will explain why. 
                        Tutorialspoint.com explains simply if the return
                        value is < 0, the second string compared is greater,
                         and if the value > 0 str1 is greater. Here, the
                         letter being compared is c versus s, s has a greater
                         number value in ASCII, leading to string 2
                         being greater after this compaison.
s1[strlen(s1)-6] = '\0';  <---- This sets the value 6 points to the right
                            of the end of the line end of what is now
                            "computerscience", and inserts the end of
                            string character '\0', this leaves 
                            "computers" as the final result.
