//2 errors in program, fix
// the errors are not declaring eigh as a double value and not declaring product iside the 
//parentheses, so product is a global variable and doesnt even do anything in the function.

double triangle_area(double base, heigh)
double product;
{
    product = base * height;
    return product / 2;

}
