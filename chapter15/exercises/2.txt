function prototypes are fine in headers, as they will declare themsleves,
and therefore they wont need to be declared or deicphered in the parent program.
b) definitions are bad,
Fordea's answer on github: IF a function is defined within a header file,
then any source file that includes the header file will need to compilerthat 
function. This will cause the function to be compiled multiple times 
instead of once if it was listed in a source file. Compiling the same 
function multiple times will cause an error at the linking stage,
because a linker only expects each function to be defined once.
