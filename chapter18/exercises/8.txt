a)an array of 10 pointers to functions with an integer parameter and a char
return type.
b)williams answer:x is a function which takes an int argument and returns
a pointer to an array of five integers.
c)x is a function with no arguments which returns a pointer to a function
which has an int argument and returns a pointer to a float.
d)x is a function with two arguments, an int and a pointer to a function 
with an int argument which returns nothing. x returns a pointer to a 
function with an int argument and no return value.

x is a function with one integer parameter, that returns a pointer to an 
array of 5 integers

c)x is a function with no arguments, returns a pointer to a function with one
integer argument, tha returns a pointer to a float.

d) x is a function with one int value, one void function that cals for a 
integer parameter, it returns a pointer to a function with one integer 
parameter with returns nothing.
THIS IS CORRECT I AM GOATED

try 3 c)x is a function with no arguments that returns a pointer to a function 
with one integer parameter that returns a pointer to a float

try 3 d)x is a function with one integer argument, and a function pointer
with one integer parameter with a return type of void. This function returns 
a pointer to a function with one integer parameter that has no return type.
