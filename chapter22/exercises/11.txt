My answer: I belive the program will indeed run, in fact, I think the program 
will run identically. That being said, the former version of the program
including parentheses ensures easier understanding, and more clearly
expresses what the program is supposed to do.

Incorrect:
Fordea states that since the ch =  has second precedence in comparison
the value will be compared with EOF first, and while this expression
is correct. It will provide ch with the result of the equality operation,
instead of the character, so the program does work partly, but fills
ch with values that simply don't fulfill the program's intentions.
