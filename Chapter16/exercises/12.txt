union {
    double a;
    struct{
        char b[4];
        double c;
        int d;
    }e;
    char f[4];
}u;

char = 1 bytes int = 4 double = 8
The union will be 8 bytes before the structure, and 24 bytes after
WRONG!

/**Correct answer 
16 bytes, the structure is the largest thing in the union, therefore the union
will be 16 bytes large.
