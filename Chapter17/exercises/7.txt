According to fordeea, after we free the memory allocated to p,
by calling = p->next. p becomes a dangling pointer, leading to undefined behavior.

there are two ways to fix this. one is using a temp pointer.
struct node *temp;
while (p!= NULL 
{
    temp = p;
    p = p->next;
    free(temp);
}

the other way is to use a next node pointer, giving it to the value 
p->next. We can then free the memeory pointed to by p, and afterwards 
assign p the next_node pointer so that it points to the next node;

struct node *next_node;

while (p != NULL)
{
    next_node = p->next;
    free(p)
    p = next_node;
}
