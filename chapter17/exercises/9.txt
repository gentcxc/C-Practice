no, because &x implies that you are sotring something inside of a instead 
of simply calling it
or 
yes, using the arrow to navigate a structure is the same as simply using periods


william herman's answer: True. When expanded, 
the right arrow operator (->), expands to the
 dereference operator and the dot operator (* and .); so,
  (&x)->a expands to *(&x).a. 
The dereference and address-of operators cancel to produce x.a.
