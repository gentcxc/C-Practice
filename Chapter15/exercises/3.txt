I wasn't too sure of the answer for this one, so i looked at fordea's answer
(suprise) and actively recalled it to make sure I understood it.

Both will work, the difference is that it will search the current directory 
for that particular header file before searching the directory in which the s
system header files are.

For example: #include "stdbool.h" will include your working directory
version of stdbool.h 

however, writing:

#include <stdbool.h> will include the version in the system header files 
directory.
