A) advantages include portability, and future tweaking / debugging.
It will be easier for programmers to understand the programs and what they
do in the future if it is split up into different files and headers.
b)disadvantages include keeping track of all of the files. You have to debug 
and rebuild the files as you change them and it can be difficult to 
keep track of it all.
